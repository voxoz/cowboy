Cowboy
======

Cowboy is a small, fast and modular HTTP server written in Erlang.

Goals
-----

Cowboy aims to provide a **complete** HTTP stack in a **small** code base.
It is optimized for **low latency** and **low memory usage**, in part
because it uses **binary strings**.

Cowboy provides **routing** capabilities, selectively dispatching requests
to handlers written in Erlang.

Because it uses Ranch for managing connections, Cowboy can easily be
**embedded** in any other application.

No parameterized module. No process dictionary. **Clean** Erlang code.

Sponsors
